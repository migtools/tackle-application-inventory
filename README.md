# Tackle Application Inventory application

The Application Inventory application is used to manage a portfolio of applications.  
The Application Inventory will allow applications to be linked to control entities within [tackle-controls](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-controls) and manage the relationships between applications.  
The Application Inventory is the gateway to applications assessment (via [tackle-pathfinder](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-pathfinder)) and analysis (via [windup](https://github.com/windup/)).
